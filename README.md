# Blackbox

Learn software engineering by building real tools, just like real
hackers do!

**Blackbox** is an open-source CLI tool with the goal of helping its
users to learn and practice real-world software system design and
implementation, by actually building them.

Blackbox will guide you step by step, while validating your progress
without any assumptions about your language or stack. Blackbox
challenges you to:

- üí° Work in your own environment and language
- üß™ Design programs from real specs (like protocols and interfaces)
- üß± Learn by doing, not by following instructions

# What's the big idea?

- Traditional tutorials, walk you through code.
- Books take lots of time and pages to get to the point.
- Online coding challenges give you puzzles.

**Blackbox** does something different: It tells you what your system
must do, and leaves the **how** completely up to you!

You'll learn by **rebuilding real-world tools from scratch**, one
stage at a time, with clear expectations, zero handholding, and fully
automated feedback (and maybe someday, by an active community).

# How Challenges Work

Each challenge, is a series of stages. Each stage is tested via
**blackbox interface checks** (e.g. send input over TCP, expect
output). No special code templates, no restrictions.

You'll get:
- ‚úÖ Confirmation when a stage passes
- ‚ùå Clear diffs when a stage fails
- üí° Optional hints if you're stuck

- Break it
- Use silly patterns
- Make mistakes
- Re-implement using worst possible tooling

That's where real learning happens. The kind you can't measure by
tests. The kind which gives you intuition!
